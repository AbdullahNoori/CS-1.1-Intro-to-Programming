# CS 1.1: Programming Fundamentals

## Course Description

This course covers the fundamentals of programming including variables, data types, control flow, conditionals, loops, lists, dictionaries, functions, and object-oriented programming. Students will master top-level concepts in software development including writing pseudocode, using functions to process input into output, technical project planning, and diagramming. The course will also cover how computers work, from components and layout to memory and machine code instructions.

### Why you should know this

This course is designed to equip students with the technical skills and foundational knowledge necessary
to succeed at Make School. A strong foundation in CS concepts is the foundation for learning in any other course.

## Tutorials & Projects

### Tutorials

Students will complete the following guided tutorials, which are intended to help you get started on new topics.  They are graded on completion only.

- [Captain Rainbow's Color Checklist](https://make.sc/rainbow-checklist)
- [Super Hero Team Dueler](http://make.sc/superhero-team-dueler)

### Projects

Students will complete the following self-guided projects, which are meant to be more challenging than tutorials to test your understanding of concepts.

- [Mad Libs](Projects/MadLibs)
- [Spaceman](Projects/Spaceman)
- [Herd Immunity Simulation](Projects/HerdImmunity)

**The first two projects require a minimum of 5 commits, while the last project requires a minimum of 10 commits. Commits must take place throughout the period of time from when they are assigned to when they are due.**

- **Good Example:** 40+ commits throughout the length of the course, looking for a healthy spattering of commits each week (such as 3-5 per day).
- **Bad Example:** 10 commits on one day during the course and no others. Students who do this will be at severe risk of not passing the class.
- **Unacceptable Example:** 2 commits the day before a project is due. Students who do this should not expect to pass the class.

#### Why are we doing this?

We want to encourage best practices that you will see working as a professional software engineer. Breaking up a project by doing a large amount of commits helps engineers in the following ways:

- It's much easier to retrace your steps if you break your project/product/code up into smaller pieces
- It helps with being able to comprehend the larger problem, and also will help with your debugging (i.e. finding exactly when you pushed that piece of broken code)
- It allows for more streamlined, iterative communication in your team, as it's much easier to hand off a small change to someone (updating a function) than a huge one (changed the architecture of the project)

Through this requirement, we hope to encourage you to think about projects with an iterative, modular mindset. Doing so will allow you to break projects down into smaller milestones that come together to make your fully-realized solution.


## Evaluation

To pass this course you must meet the following requirements:

- Complete all required tutorials
- Pass all projects according to the [Project Rubrics](https://make.sc/cs11-rubric)
- Pass the final summative assessment.  Use the [Study Guide](https://make.sc/cs11-study-guide) to prepare
- Actively participate in class and abide by the attendance policy
- Make up all classwork from all absences

## Attendance

Just like any job, attendance at Make School is required and a key component of your success. Attendance is being onsite from 9:30 to 5:30 each day, attending all scheduled sessions including classes, huddles, coaching and school meetings, and working in the study labs when not in a scheduled session. Working onsite allows you to learn with your peers, have access to support from TAs, instructors and others, and is vital to your learning.

Attendance requirements for scheduled sessions are:
- No more than two no call no shows per term in any scheduled session.
- No more than four excused absences per term in any scheduled session.

Failure to meet these requirements will result in a PIP (Participation Improvement Plan).  Failure to improve after the PIP is cause for not being allowed to continue at Make School.
