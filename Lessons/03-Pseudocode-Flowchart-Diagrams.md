## Learning Objectives
By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
1. Appreciate the value of representing program flow with diagrams
2. Draw flowchart diagrams using common symbols and shapes
3. Translate flowcharts into pseudocode and programming structures
4. Use flowcharts to identify and solve issues with program loops

## Pseudocode
- Teacher talk and demo pseudocode for making a sandwich (10 min)
- Play Spaceman word guessing game with class (10 min)
- Design pseudocode for [Spaceman project] (20 min)
- Compare pseudocode with partners and give feedback (10 min)

Break (5 min)

## Rock Paper Scissors
- Rock Paper Scissors tournament (5 min)
  - Find a partner and play Rock Paper Scissors
  - The winner plays a new round with another winner
  - The loser cheers for the winner in future rounds
  - Winners find another undefeated winner to play against
  - Keep playing until only one undefeated winner remains
- Why diagrams are useful to understand program flow (10 min)
  - Show flowchart that explains process of how to [debug a lamp]
  - Explain flowchart symbols and structures with [guide to delivery services][Bring me what]
- Rock Paper Scissors flowchart diagramming (20 min)
  - Get a small whiteboard and marker
  - Draw a flowchart diagram for Rock Paper Scissors
  - Find a partner to compare and contrast your flowcharts with
    - Is it easy to understand visually?
    - Does it contain loops and end states?
    - Is the underlying structure the same?
    - Does it use similar symbos and shapes?
  - Refine your flowchart based on seeing other students' diagrams
